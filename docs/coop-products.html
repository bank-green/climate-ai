Ethical.svg
Why choose us?

It’s our values and ethics that really set us apart as a bank— and it
always has been, since 1872.

With a customer-led Ethical Policy
<https://www.co-operativebank.co.uk/values-and-ethics/>, we give you a
say in how your money is used, as well as standing up for the causes
that matter to you and our colleagues. Because unlike a lot of banks, we
don’t finance the production or extraction of fossil fuels, fund logging
in the Amazon, or do business with organisations that fail to implement
basic human rights.

*Your money has power.* And putting it in the right place can make all
the difference.


    Refer a Friend – receive £125 for you and £125 for your friend too

If you're an existing current account customer with us, recommend a
Co-operative Bank Current Account or Everyday Extra account to your
friends and family and *we’ll give you both £125 after they switch.*
Eligibility criteria and T&Cs apply.
