Environmental, Social and
Ethical Risk Policy Summary
Forestry, Fisheries and
Agribusiness Sectors
The NatWest Group plc and its subsidiaries (the NatWest Group) Environmental,
Social and Ethical (ESE) risk management framework is one of a number of risk
management systems we operate, comprising policies and processes to give us
better insight into our customers’ activities, help address issues of concern, minimise
risks to the bank and manage stakeholder expectations. It gives clear guidance to
staff on the procedures they must follow in relation to ESE risks when dealing with
customers and transactions.
Our policies reflect adherence to national and international laws and regulations,
wherever they apply. We have also incorporated a number of voluntary standards
such as the Equator Principles and the UN Global Compact.
Scope
This policy covers the NatWest Group lending and services provided to companies and projects related to the forestry,
fisheries and agriculture sectors. This includes activities such as timber, palm oil or soy production and plantations,
significant cattle ranching in specified countries, management of peat lands or damaging fishing practices.

Context
Forestry, fisheries and agribusiness industries provide many useful products for the global population, are vital
sources of food, fibre and animal feed, and contribute towards transportation biofuels and emerging bio-products
industries. But the growing demand for such products, compounded by global population growth, is resulting in
significant environmental and social impacts. The expansion of ‘soft commodities’ markets and the growing use of
intensive farming and fishing methods is placing significant strain on our natural environment through the clearance
of forests, damage to fish populations and other impacts. These trends also have the potential to reduce the ability of
forests, peat lands and other natural environments to play their role in absorbing CO2 emissions, protect biodiversity
and provide sources of sustainable livelihoods for local people.
The ‘Soft Commodities Compact’ – developed by the Banking Environment Initiative and the Consumer Goods Forum
- is a key initiative created to address some of these issues. The NatWest Group is a signatory of the Soft Commodities
Compact, which aims to mobilise the banking industry to help transform soft commodity supply chains, thereby
helping clients to achieve zero net deforestation by 2020.

Our ESE policy requirements
We expect and encourage our customers to demonstrate commitment and compliance to mitigating ESE risk through:
•

Having in place and embedding policies and plans which demonstrate a good understanding of ESE issues.

•

Demonstrating the capacity to manage these risks through good governance and controls.

•

A positive track record of managing ESE risks.

•

A commitment to transparency.

Within our policy we set out Prohibited, Restricted and Normal activities. We do not support customers and/or
transactions involved in prohibited activities.
Customers engaged in restricted activities undergo enhanced due diligence including review by a reputational
risk forum or approver and evaluation every one or two years. Customers undertaking ‘normal’ (lower risk)
activities are assessed for ESE on a five-yearly basis.
Updated February 2023

Project-specific lending

Environmental, Social and
Ethical Risk Policy Summary
Oil and Gas Sector
The NatWest Group plc and its subsidiaries (the NatWest Group) Environmental,
Social and Ethical (ESE) risk management framework is one of a number of risk
management systems we operate, comprising policies and processes to give us
better insight into our customers’ activities, help address issues of concern,
minimise risks to the bank and manage stakeholder expectations. It gives clear
guidance to staff on the procedures they must follow in relation to ESE risks when
dealing with customers and transactions.
Our policies reflect adherence to national and international laws and
regulations, wherever they apply. We have also incorporated a number of
voluntary standards such as the Equator Principles and the UN Global
Compact.
Scope
This policy covers NatWest Group support provided to companies involved in the exploration and
production (upstream), transportation and storage (midstream) and refinement and processing
(downstream) of oil and gas. This includes conventional sources of oil and gas as well less
conventional sources such as oil sands and shale gas.

Context
As a purpose-led bank we champion potential, helping people, families and businesses to
thrive.
NatWest Group have an ambition to be the leading bank in the UK in helping to address the
climate challenge. While the oil and gas sector continues to play a critical role in UK energy
security and the transition to clean energy, NatWest Group recognises the significant climate,
environmental and social risks associated with it. We are committed to managing these risks
and uphold human rights.
To support our climate ambition, we are reducing our current levels of lending for the
upstream oil and gas extraction sector.
From February 2023, we will not provide reserve based lending specifically for the purpose of
financing oil and gas exploration, extraction and production for new customers, and, after, the
31st December 2025, we will not renew, refinance or extend existing reserve based lending
specifically for the purpose for financing oil and gas exploration, extraction and production.
We also announced in February 2022 that we will only support upstream oil and gas
companies:
•

where the majority of their assets being financed* are based in the UK (onshore or
offshore UK Continental shelf); and,

•

where those companies report to us the overall emissions of the assets they operate by
the end of 2023.

We have also stopped lending and underwriting to oil and gas majors unless they had a
credible transition plan aligned to the 2015 Paris agreement in place by the end of 2021.
All relationships with oil and gas majors are rated high ESE risk to allow for annual review and
monitoring via Reputational Risk Committee.

Our purpose is to champion potential, helping people, families and businesses to thrive. This lies at the
core of our activity as we strive to create long term, deeper relationships with our customers. At the
heart of our purpose is a clear commitment to people – to value, support, empower them and ultimately
enable them to thrive. Respect for human rights is linked to our purpose, reflected in Our values and we
seek to embed it throughout our business. We strive to be an open and inclusive business that supports
respect for human rights whilst also seeking to identify and mitigate any negative impacts that our
activities may have on individuals or communities**.
Our Oil and Gas Risk Acceptance Criteria helps limit lending and loan underwriting activities that do not
align to our purpose.

** NWG Human Rights Statement 2021

Our ESE policy requirements
We recognise that the activities of our customers can have environmental, social and ethical (ESE) impacts
– including polluting activities and the potential for human rights infringements. To help us assess and
manage these risks, we have an ESE Risk Framework comprising of policies and processes to give us better
insight into our customers’ activities and address issues of concern to minimise risks to the bank and
manage stakeholder expectations.
ESE sector Risk Acceptance Criteria define the level of ESE risk the bank is prepared to accept, and our
expectations of companies to manage ESE risks. This includes having relevant policies and procedures
which demonstrate a good understanding of ESE issues and the capacity to manage these risks through
good governance and controls. It also includes a positive track record of managing ESE risks and a
commitment to transparency. Our policies reflect applicable national and international laws and take into
account good international practice, for example managing climate change. They also incorporate a
number of voluntary standards such as the Equator Principles and the UN Global Compact. We also expect
our customers to adhere to local and international environmental, social and human rights standards. The
policies apply to all legal entities within the Group.
Our ESE policies are reviewed and updated regularly to ensure they reflect the evolving risk landscape.
They classify activities into three categories; Prohibited, Restricted and Normal risk. We do not support
customer activity or individual transactions which are prohibited. We complete an ESE Risk Assessments for
customers engaged in restricted activities, when the relationship is established and then every one or two
years thereafter. The final risk assessment is presented to a specialist risk committee or accountable
executive for approval. Customers with activities limited to ‘normal’ (lower risk) ESE activities, are assessed
every five years, unless an event triggers a review in the interim period.

into our customers’ activities and address issues of concern to minimise risks to the bank and manage
stakeholder expectations.
ESE sector Risk Acceptance Criteria define the level of ESE risk the bank is prepared to accept, and our
expectations of companies to manage ESE risks. This includes having relevant policies and procedures which
demonstrate a good understanding of ESE issues and the capacity to manage these risks thr ough good
governance and controls. It also includes a positive track record of managing ESE risks and a commitment to
transparency. Our policies reflect applicable national and international laws and take into account good
international practice, for example managing climate change. They also incorporate a number of voluntary
standards such as the Equator Principles and the UN Global Compact. We also expect our customers to
adhere to local and international environmental, social and human rights standards. The policies apply to all
legal entities within the Group.
Our ESE policies are reviewed and updated regularly to ensure they reflect the evolving risk landscape. They
classify activities into three categories; Prohibited, Restricted and Normal risk. We do not support customer
activity or individual transactions which are prohibited. We complete an ESE Risk Assessments for customers
engaged in restricted activities, when the relationship is established and then every one or two years
thereafter. The final risk assessment is presented to a specialist risk committee or accountable executive for
approval. Customers with activities limited to ‘normal’ (lower risk) ESE activities, are assessed every five
years, unless an event triggers a review in the interim period.
